### General Info
***
The objective of this study is to analyze patterns in vehicle sales using the unsupervised learning technique called <b>Clustering</b> to identify behavior and characteristics of the most representative groups, and based on the conclusions to design a  efficient strategy to classify a vehicle according to its relevant characteristics and predict its sales price. This will allow evaluating the effectiveness of the strategy in a certain group of vehicle sales (cluster), having sales with similar behavioral patterns as a reference.

<b>Objectives:</b>
- Know the basics of exploratory analysis
- Create data visualizations using the Plotly library
- Uses KMeans, DBSCAN and Mean Shift methods to group data without classification
- Learn to group clients
- Evaluate the quality of a clustering through the calculation of the Silhouette coefficient
- Parameterizes clustering methods through the maximum Silhouette coefficient
